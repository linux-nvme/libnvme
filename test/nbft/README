This is a simple testcase to verify the NBFT parser output over a set
of provided ACPI NBFT tables.

The 'nbft-dump' test utility is a simple tool to print out all elements
and nested arrays of the nbft_info structs, bearing only minimal logic.

The 'tables' directory contains sample binary files taken from
/sys/firmware/acpi/tables. The 'tables_bad' then contains experiments, older
table revisions or malformed data to test the parser error path.

The "diffs" directory contains reference output generated by the 'nbft-dump'
utility that is being compared against actual testcase run output. Everytime
'nbft-dump.c' is modified these reference output files need to be regenerated
by calling `ninja -C .build nbft-diffs` over the configured meson project.

The tests are typically ran as part of the standard `meson test -C .build`
invocation.
