device self-test operation. A device self-test operation is a diagnostic

The controller may return a response to this command immediately while
running the self-test in the background.

Set the 'nsid' field to 0 to not include namespaces in the test. Set to
0xffffffff to test all namespaces. All other values tests a specific
namespace, if present.
