/**
 * DOC: mi.h - NVMe Management Interface library (libnvme-mi) definitions.
 *
 * These provide an abstraction for the MI messaging between controllers
 * and a host, typically over an MCTP-over-i2c link to a NVMe device, used
 * as part of the out-of-band management of a system.
 *
 * We have a few data structures define here to reflect the topology
 * of a MI connection with an NVMe subsystem:
 *
 *  - &nvme_mi_ep_t: an MI endpoint - our mechanism of communication with a
 *    NVMe subsystem. For MCTP, an endpoint will be the component that
 *    holds the MCTP address (EID), and receives our request message.
 *
 *    endpoints are defined in the NVMe-MI spec, and are specific to the MI
 *    interface.
 *
 *    Each endpoint will provide access to one or more of:
 *
 *  - &nvme_mi_ctrl_t: a NVMe controller, as defined by the NVMe base spec.
 *    The controllers are responsible for processing any NVMe standard
 *    commands (eg, the Admin command set). An endpoint (&nvme_mi_ep_t)
 *    may provide access to multiple controllers - so each of the controller-
 *    type commands will require a &nvme_mi_ctrl_t to be specified, rather than
 *    an endpoint
 *
 * A couple of conventions with the libnvme-mi API:
 *
 *  - All types and functions have the nvme_mi prefix, to distinguish from
 *    the libnvme core.
 *
 *  - We currently support either MI commands and Admin commands. The
 *    former adds a _mi prefix, the latter an _admin prefix. [This does
 *    result in the MI functions having a double _mi, like
 *    &nvme_mi_mi_subsystem_health_status_poll, which is apparently amusing
 *    for our German-speaking readers]
 *
 * For return values: unless specified in the per-function documentation,
 * all functions:
 *
 *  - return 0 on success
 *
 *  - return -1, with errno set, for errors communicating with the MI device,
 *    either in request or response data
 *
 *  - return >1 on MI status errors. This value is the 8-bit MI status
 *    value, represented by &enum nvme_mi_resp_status. Note that the
 *    status values may be vendor-defined above 0xe0.
 *
 * For the second case, we have a few conventions for errno values:
 *
 *  - EPROTO: response data violated the MI protocol, and libnvme cannot
 *    validly interpret the response
 *
 *  - EIO: Other I/O error communicating with device (eg., valid but
 *    unexpected response data)
 *
 *  - EINVAL: invalid input arguments for a command
 *
 * In line with the core NVMe API, the Admin command functions take an
 * `_args` structure to provide the command-specific parameters. However,
 * for the MI interface, the fd and timeout members of these _args structs
 * are ignored.
 *
 * References to the specifications here will either to be the NVM Express
 * Management Interface ("NVMe-MI") or the NVM Express Base specification
 * ("NVMe"). At the time of writing, the versions we're referencing here
 * are:
 *  - NVMe-MI 1.2b
 *  - NVMe 2.0b
 * with a couple of accommodations for older spec types, particularly NVMe-MI
 * 1.1, where possible.
