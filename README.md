libnvme
-------

This is the libnvme development C library. libnvme provides type
defintions for NVMe specification structures, enumerations, and bit
fields, helper functions to construct, dispatch, and decode commands
and payloads, and utilities to connect, scan, and manage nvme devices
on a Linux system.

The public specification is the authority to resolve any protocol
discrepencies with this library. For more info on NVM Express, please see:

## Building with meson

By Martin BÃ©langer 

I added support for the [meson build system](https://mesonbuild.com/) in July 2021. I did not remove the existing Makefiles at this time, which can still be used as usual. I wanted to give users and the Maintainer, Keith Busch, time to review the changes and experiment with meson. If that goes well, we can consider removing the Makefiles at a later time.

### What is the meson build system?

Here's an excerpt from the meson web site: *Meson is **an open source build system** meant to be both extremely fast, and, even more importantly, as user friendly as possible. The main design point of Meson is that every moment a developer spends writing or debugging build definitions is a second wasted.*

Several well-known projects such as `systemd` and `Gnome` use meson as their build system. A summary of projects using meson can be found [here](https://mesonbuild.com/Users.html). For more info on meson, please consult the following sites:

**Wiki page**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson_(software)

**meson documentation**: https://mesonbuild.com/

**meson repo**: https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson

### Prerequisite

First, install meson.

**Debian / Ubuntu**:

```bash
sudo apt-get install meson
```

**Fedora / Red Hat**:

```bash
sudo dnf install meson
```

### To compile libnvme

Using meson is similar to projects that use a `configure` script before running `make`.

To `configure` the project:

```
meson .build
```

One nice feature of meson is that it doesn't mix build artifacts (e.g. `*.o`, `*.so`, etc.) with source code. In the above example, "`.build`" is the name of the directory where the build configuration as well as all the build artifacts will be saved. This directory can be named anything as long as it's not an existing source directory. To completely "clean" all the build artifacts, one need only delete the `.build` directory.

To compile:

```
cd .build
ninja
```

Or:

```
ninja -C .build
```

### To install libnvme

To install `libnvme`:

```
cd .build
meson install
```

### To run unit tests

To run unit tests:

```
cd .build
meson test
```

### To clean after a build

To perform the equivalent of a `make clean` without deleting the build configuration.

```
cd .build
ninja -t clean
```

Or:

```
ninja -C .build -t clean
```

### To purge everything

To completely clean all build artifacts, including the build configuration.

```
rm -rf .build
```

### Supported build options

A few build options can be specified on the command line when invoking meson.

| Option  | Values [default]    | Description                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| systemd | [auto], true, false | Whether to link libsystemd to libnvme. When set to `auto`, the default, meson will check for the presence of library and will only link to it if it is found. When set to `true`, meson will make this library a mandatory dependency. When set to `false`, meson will not link the library to libnvme, even if the library is available. |
| uuid    | [auto], true, false | Whether to link libuuid to libnvme. When set to `auto`, the default, meson will check for the presence of library and will only link to it if it is found. When set to `true`, meson will make this library a mandatory dependency. When set to `false`, meson will not link the library to libnvme, even if the library is available. |
| json-c  | [auto], true, false | Whether to link libjson-c to libnvme. When set to `auto`, the default, meson will check for the presence of library and will only link to it if it is found. When set to `true`, meson will make this library a mandatory dependency. When set to `false`, meson will not link the library to libnvme, even if the library is available. |

#### Changing the build options from the command-line (i.e. w/o modifying any files)

Here's an example where we tell meson that we do not want to link against the `systemd` library, but we want to link with the `uuid` library:

```bash
meson .build -Dsystemd=false -Duuid=true
```

To configure a build for debugging purposes (i.e. optimization turned off and debug symbols enabled):

```bash
meson .build -Dbuildtype=debug
```

To enable address sanitizer (advanced debugging of memory issues):

```bash
meson .build -Db_sanitize=address
```

To list configuration options that are available and possible values:

```bash
meson configure .build
```
